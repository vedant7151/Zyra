  So, we need to finalize the proposal for the new project. Has everyone had a chance to review the draft?

  Yes, I went through it yesterday. I think it covers most of the key points, but we might need to elaborate on the budget section. It’s a bit vague right now.

  I agree. We should break down the costs more specifically. For example, the equipment expenses and training costs need separate line items.

  Good point. I can take a look at the budget and add more details. I’ll have an updated version ready by tomorrow.

  That works. What about the timeline? Are we confident we can meet the deadlines outlined in the draft?

  It’s tight, but I think it’s doable as long as there are no unexpected delays. We’ll need to ensure each team sticks to their deliverables.

  Speaking of delays, there’s been an issue with the supplier for the raw materials. We might want to consider a backup vendor just in case.

  I can follow up on that and start looking for alternatives. We don’t want this to become a bottleneck later.

  Agreed. Let’s prioritize that. Anything else before we wrap up?

  Just one thing—I think we should set up a weekly check-in to monitor progress. That way, we can catch any issues early.

  That’s a good idea. Let’s schedule something for every Friday afternoon.

  Perfect. Thanks, everyone. Let’s stay on top of these tasks and keep things moving.
